PUC Code 8281-8286,"Women, Minority, Disabled Veteran, and LGBT Business Enterprises ",California,2019,"(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free, open, and transparent competition. Only through free, open, and transparent competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be ensured. The preservation and expansion of that competition are basic to the economic well-being of this state and that well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is encouraged and developed. Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state to aid the interests of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises in order to preserve reasonable and just prices and a free competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for commodities, supplies, technology, property, and services for regulated public utilities, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, are awarded to women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the state. (b) (1) The Legislature finds all of the following: (A) The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is essential if this state is to attain social and economic equality for those businesses and improve the functioning of the state economy. (B) Public agencies and some regulated utilities that have established short- and long-range women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprise goals are awarding 30 percent or more of their contracts to these business enterprises. (C) Women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises have traditionally received less than a proportionate share of regulated public utility procurement contracts, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects. (D) It is in the state’s interest to expeditiously improve the economically disadvantaged position of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (E) The position of these businesses can be substantially improved by providing long-range substantial goals for procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses. (F) That procurement also benefits the regulated public utilities and consumers of the state by encouraging the expansion of the number of suppliers for procurements, thereby encouraging competition among the suppliers and promoting economic efficiency in the process. (G) That the long-term economic viability of this state depends substantially upon the ability of renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects to incorporate women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses into those projects. (2) It is the purpose of this article to do all of the following: (A) Encourage greater economic opportunity for women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (B) Promote competition among regulated public utility suppliers in order to enhance economic efficiency in the procurement of electrical, gas, water, wireless telecommunications service provider, and telephone corporation contracts and contracts of their commission-regulated subsidiaries and affiliates. (C) Clarify and expand the program for the procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. … (a) The commission shall require each electrical corporation, gas corporation, water corporation, wireless telecommunications service provider, electric service provider, and telephone corporation with gross annual California revenues exceeding twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), and their commission-regulated subsidiaries and affiliates, to submit annually a detailed and verifiable plan for increasing procurement from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises in all categories, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, energy storage system, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, vegetation management, and rail projects. … (f) The commission shall require each electrical corporation, gas corporation, water corporation, wireless telecommunications service provider, electric service provider, and telephone corporation with gross annual California revenues exceeding fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000), but not more than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), to annually submit data in a simplified form to the commission on its procurement from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises in all categories, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, energy storage system, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, vegetation management, and rail projects.",10398915,17177441,10745152,25966966,14425447,4438230,29431629,25400983,27373958,11098767,5870321,6657099,8193292,16612419,6093691,11887822,11378020,2856992,704382,1656854,589279,55771,93408,38731,118980,10583854,9822104,478520,83463,10900332,49348,89999,13644,21954827,22502720,17677228,5007885,12902372,19155791,6154262,5184764,5172630,17087949,17971664,3139703,4950496,4903185,15524,9911,25435,5218,9

(b) (1) (A) The goal of the program is, no later than December 31, 2022, to approve funding for infrastructure projects that will provide broadband access to no less than 98 percent of California households in each consortia region, as identified by the commission on or before January 1, 2017. The commission shall be responsible for achieving the goals of the program. (B) For purposes of this section, “unserved household” means a household for which no facility-based broadband provider offers broadband service at Speed of at least 6 megabits per second (mbps) downstream and one mbps upstream. (2) In approving infrastructure projects, the commission shall do both of the following: (A) Approve projects that provide last-mile broadband access to households that are unserved by an existing facility-based broadband provider, and, upon accomplishment of the goal of the program specified in paragraph (1), also approve projects pursuant to paragraph (15) of subdivision (f). (B) (i) Give preference to projects in areas where Internet connectivity is available only through dial-up service that are not served by any form of wireline or wireless facility-based broadband service or areas with no Internet connectivity. (ii) This subparagraph does not prohibit the commission from approving funding for projects outside of the areas specified in clause (i). (c) The commission shall establish the following accounts within the fund: (1) The Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account. (2) The Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account. (3) The Broadband Public Housing Account. (4) The Broadband Adoption Account.

Moneys collected shall be deposited in the following amounts in the following accounts:(A) Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) into the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account. (B) Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account. (C) Twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) into the Broadband Adoption Account. (2) All interest earned on moneys in the fund shall be deposited in the fund. (3) The commission may collect a sum not to exceed three hundred thirty million dollars ($330,000,000) for a sum total of moneys collected by imposing the surcharge described in paragraph (1). The commission may collect the sum beginning with the calendar year starting on January 1, 2018, and continuing through the 2022 calendar year, in an amount not to exceed sixty-six million dollars ($66,000,000) per year, unless the commission determines that collecting a higher amount in any year will not result in an increase in the total amount of all surcharges collected from telephone customers that year. (e) All moneys in the California Advanced Services Fund shall be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the commission for the program administered by the commission pursuant to this section, including the costs incurred by the commission in developing, implementing, and administering the program and the fund. (f) (1) The commission shall award grants from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account on a technology-neutral basis, including both wireline and wireless technology. (2) The commission shall consult with regional consortia, stakeholders, local governments, existing facility-based broadband providers, and consumers regarding unserved areas and cost-effective strategies to achieve the broadband access goal through public workshops conducted at least annually no later than April 30 of each year through year 2022. (3) The commission shall identify unserved rural and urban areas and delineate the areas in the annual report prepared pursuant to Section 914.7. (4) (A) (i) The commission shall annually offer an existing facility-based broadband provider the opportunity to demonstrate that it will deploy broadband or upgrade existing facilities to a delineated unserved area within 180 days. (ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), the commission shall not approve funding for a project to deploy broadband to a delineated unserved area if the existing facility-based broadband provider demonstrates to the commission, in response to the commission’s annual offer, that it will deploy broadband or upgrade existing broadband service throughout the project area. (iii) If the existing facility-based broadband provider is unable to complete the deployment of broadband within the delineated unserved area within 180 days, the provider shall provide the commission with information to demonstrate what progress has been made or challenges faced in completing the deployment. If the commission finds that the provider is making progress towards the completion of the deployment, the commission shall extend the time to complete the project beyond the 180 days. If the commission finds that the provider is not making progress towards completing the deployment, the delineated unserved area shall be eligible for funding pursuant to this subdivision. (B) (i) Except for information specified in clause (ii), information submitted to the commission that includes the provider’s plans for future broadband deployment shall not be publicly disclosed. (ii) The commission may publicly disclose information regarding the area designated for a broadband deployment, the number of households or locations to be served, and the estimated date by which the deployment will be completed. (C) An existing facility-based broadband provider may, but is not required to, apply for funding from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account to make an upgrade pursuant to this subdivision. (5) Projects eligible for grant awards shall meet all of the following requirements: (A) The project deploys infrastructure capable of providing broadband access at Speed of a minimum of 10 megabits per second (mbps) downstream and one mbps upstream to unserved households in census blocks where no provider offers access at Speed of at least 6 mbps downstream and one mbps upstream. (B) All or a significant portion of the project deploys last-mile infrastructure to provide service to unserved households. Projects that only deploy middle-mile infrastructure are not eligible for grant funding. For a project that includes funding for middle-mile infrastructure, the commission shall verify that the proposed middle-mile infrastructure is indispensable for accessing the last-mile infrastructure. (C) (i) Except as provided in clause (ii), until July 1, 2020, the project is not located in a census block where an existing facility-based broadband provider has accepted federal funds for broadband deployment from Phase II of the Connect America Fund, unless the existing facility-based broadband provider has notified the commission before July 1, 2020, that it has completed its Connect America Fund deployment in the census block.(ii) An existing facility-based broadband provider is eligible for a grant pursuant to this subdivision to supplement a grant pursuant to Phase II of the Connect America Fund to expand broadband service within identified census blocks, as needed. (6) (A) An individual household or property owner shall be eligible to apply for a grant to offset the costs of connecting the household or property to an existing or proposed facility-based broadband provider. Any infrastructure built to connect a household or property with funds provided under this paragraph shall become the property of, and part of, the network of the facility-based broadband provider to which it is connected.(B) (i) In approving a project pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall consider limiting funding to households based on income so that funds are provided only to households that would not otherwise be able to afford a line extension to the property, limiting the amount of grants on a per-household basis, and requiring a percentage of the project to be paid by the household or the owner of the property. (ii) The aggregate amount of grants awarded pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000). (7) An entity that is not a telephone corporation shall be eligible to apply to participate in the program administered by the commission pursuant to this section to provide access to broadband to an unserved household, if the entity otherwise meets the eligibility requirements and complies with program requirements established by the commission.(8) The commission shall provide each applicant, and any party challenging an application, the opportunity to demonstrate actual levels of broadband service in the project area, which the commission shall consider in reviewing the application.(9) A local governmental agency may be eligible for an infrastructure grant only if the infrastructure project is for an unserved household or business, the commission has conducted an open application process, and no other eligible entity applied.(10) The commission shall establish a service list of interested parties to be notified of any California Advanced Services Fund applications. Any application and any amendment to an application for project funding shall be served to those on the service list and posted on the commission’s Internet Web site at least 30 days before publishing the corresponding draft resolution. (11) A grant awarded pursuant to this subdivision may include funding for the following costs consistent with paragraph (5) of subdivision (f): (A) Costs directly related to the deployment of infrastructure. (B) Costs to lease access to property or for Internet backhaul services for a period not to exceed five years. (C) Cost incurred by an existing facility-based broadband provider to upgrade its existing facilities to provide for interconnection. (12) A grant from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account shall not include funding for costs of broadband infrastructure already funded by the Connect America Fund program or other similar federal public program that funds that infrastructure. This paragraph does not apply to funding from the federal high-cost support programs that support operations, including High Cost Loop Support (HCLS), Connect America Fund-Broadband Loop Support (CAF-BLS), or the Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM). (13) The commission may award grants to fund all or a portion of the project. The commission shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, the level of funding to be provided for a project and shall consider factors that include, but are not limited to, the location and accessibility of the area, the existence of communication facilities that may be upgraded to deploy broadband, and whether the project makes a significant contribution to achievement of the program goal. (14) The commission may require each infrastructure grant applicant to indicate steps taken to first obtain any available funding from the Connect America Fund program or similar federal public programs that fund broadband infrastructure. This paragraph does not authorize the commission to reject a grant application on the basis that an applicant failed to seek project funding from the Connect America Fund program or another similar federal public program. (15) Upon the accomplishment of the goal of the program specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), not more than thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) of the moneys remaining in the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account shall be available for infrastructure projects that provide last-mile broadband access to households to which no facility-based broadband provider offers broadband service at Speed of at least 10 mbps downstream and one mbps upstream.",10671987,17209436,10935816,24502966,12793334,2599530,28601340,24602909,26582936,10627650,5696221,6363688,7714649,15288781,5836510,11753594,11192594,2834987,526303,1488416,629698,230931,25037,73807,32266,10187480,9701280,495765,71210,10775808,18988,90956,30927,21684716,21663017,17578808,4950520,11862723,17526346,6008127,5197350,4475504,16111546,16366037,2853167,3118367,4874486,15524,9911,25435,5218,6

PUC Code 5810,The Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ,California,2007,"(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (1) Increasing competition for video and broadband services is a matter of statewide concern for all of the following reasons: (A) Video and cable services provide numerous benefits to all Californians including access to a variety of news, public information, education, and entertainment programming. (B) Increased competition in the cable and video service sector provides consumers with more choice, lowers prices, speeds the deployment of new communication and broadband technologies, creates jobs, and benefits the California economy.(C) To promote competition, the state should establish a state-issued franchise authorization process that allows market participants to use their networks and systems to provide video, voice, and broadband services to all residents of the state. (D) Competition for video service should increase opportunities for programming that appeals to California’s diverse population and many cultural communities. (2) Legislation to develop this new process should adhere to the following principles:(A) Create a fair and level playing field for all market competitors that does not disadvantage or advantage one service provider or technology over another. (B) Promote the widespread access to the most technologically advanced cable and video services to all California communities in a nondiscriminatory manner regardless of socioeconomic status.(C) Protect local government revenues and control of public rights-of-way. (D) Require market participants to comply with all applicable consumer protection laws. (E) Complement efforts to increase investment in broadband infrastructure and close the digital divide. (F) Continue access to and maintenance of the public, education, and government (PEG) channels. (G) Maintain all existing authority of the California Public Utilities Commission as established in state and federal statutes. (3) The public interest is best served when sufficient funds are appropriated to the commission to provide adequate staff and resources to appropriately and timely process applications of video service providers and to ensure full compliance with the requirements of this division. It is the intent of the Legislature that, although video service providers are not public utilities or common carriers, the commission shall collect any fees authorized by this division in the same manner and under the same terms as it collects fees from common carriers, electrical corporations, gas corporations, telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, water corporations, and every other public utility providing service directly to customers or subscribers subject to its jurisdiction such that it does not discriminate against video service providers or their subscribers. (4) Providing an incumbent cable operator the option to secure a state-issued franchise through the preemption of an existing cable franchise between a cable operator and any political subdivision of the state, including, but not limited to, a charter city, county, or city and county, is an essential element of the new regulatory framework established by this act as a matter of statewide concern to best ensure equal protection and parity among providers and technologies, as well as to achieve the goals stated by the Legislature in enacting this act. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that a video service provider shall pay as rent a franchise fee to the local entity in whose jurisdiction service is being provided for the continued use of streets, public facilities, and other rights-of-way of the local entity in order to provide service. The Legislature recognizes that local entities should be compensated for the use of the public rights-of-way and that the franchise fee is intended to compensate them in the form of rent or a toll, similar to that which the court found to be appropriate in Santa Barbara County Taxpayers Association v. Board of Supervisors for the County of Santa Barbara (1989) 209 Cal. App. 3d 940.(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that collective bargaining agreements be respected.

(b) For aerial and underground electric utility transmission lines designed to operate at 69 or more kilovolts that are needed to accommodate the additional electrical transfer capacity on the transmission grid resulting from new base-load generating facilities, the department’s rules shall provide for placement of and access to such transmission lines adjacent to and within the right-of-way of any department-controlled public roads, including longitudinally within limited access facilities where there is no other practicable alternative available, to the greatest extent allowed by federal law, if compliance with the standards established by such rules is achieved. Without limiting or conditioning the department’s jurisdiction or authority described in paragraph (a), with respect to limited access right-of-way, such rules may include, but need not be limited to, that the use of the right-of-way for longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines is reasonable based upon a consideration of economic and environmental factors, including, without limitation, other practicable alternative alignments, utility corridors and easements, impacts on adjacent property owners, and minimum clear zones and other safety standards, and further provide that placement of the electric utility transmission lines within the department’s right-of-way does not interfere with operational requirements of the transportation facility or planned or potential future expansion of such transportation facility. If the department approves longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines in limited access facilities, compensation for the use of the right-of-way is required. Such consideration or compensation paid by the electric utility in connection with the department’s issuance of a permit does not create any property right in the department’s property regardless of the amount of consideration paid or the improvements constructed on the property by the utility.

The electric utility shall pay to the department reasonable damages resulting from the utility’s failure or refusal to timely remove or relocate its transmission lines. The rules to be adopted by the department may also address the compensation methodology and removal or relocation.

The General Assembly also finds and declares that guaranteeing an equitable deployment of broadband services throughout the state is a public necessity, one of the basic functions of government, and a benefit to the entire state. Moreover, the General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interest of the state and the persons who live and work in the state to spend state funds through the establishment of a grant program to ensure the creation of a state-wide foundation of broadband services infrastructure in unserved areas of the state.

""Satellite carrier"" means any person using the facilities of a satellite or satellite services licensed by the federal communications commission and operating a fixed-satellite service or direct broadcast satellite services to provide point-to-multipoint distribution of signals. ""Other wireless carrier"" means any person, other than a telecommunications carrier, commercial mobile service carrier, cable operator, open video operator, or satellite carrier, providing broadband services to subscribers through the radio transmission of energy. (v) In the case of packet switching equipment, such packet equipment installed in connection with other qualifying equipment listed in subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iv) of this section, provided it is the last in a series of equipment that transmits signals to a subscriber or the first in a series of equipment that transmits signals from a subscriber. ""Packet switching"" means controlling or routing the path of a digital transmission signal which is assembled into packets or cells. (vi) In the case of multiplexing and demultiplexing equipment, such equipment only to the extent that it is deployed in connection with providing broadband services in locations between packet switching equipment and the structure in which the subscriber is located. ""Multiplexing"" means the transmission of two (2) or more signals over a communications circuit without regard to the communications technology. (vii) Any property not primarily used to provide services in Idaho to public subscribers is not qualified broadband equipment. (4) No equipment described in subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(vi) of this section shall qualify for the credit provided in subsection (1) of this section until the taxpayer applies to and obtains from the Idaho public utilities commission an order confirming that the installed equipment is qualified broadband equipment. Applications submitted to the commission shall be governed by the commission’s rules of procedure. The commission may issue procedural orders necessary to implement this section. (5) The credit allowed by subsection (1) of this section together with any credits carried forward under subsection (7) of this section shall not, in any one (1) taxable year, exceed the lesser of: (a) The amount of tax due under sections 63-3024, 63-3025 and 63-3025A, Idaho Code, after allowance for all other credits permitted by this chapter; or (b) Seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000). When credits earned in more than one (1) taxable year are available, the oldest credits shall be applied first. (6) In the case of a group of corporations filing a combined report under subsection (t) of section 63-3027, Idaho Code, credit earned by one (1) member of the group but not used by that member may be used by another member of the group, subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, instead of carried over. For a combined group of corporations, credit carried forward may be claimed by any member of the group unless the member who earned the credit is no longer included in the combined group. (7) If the credit allowed by subsection (1) of this section exceeds the limitation under subsection (5) of this section, the excess amount may be carried forward for a period that does not exceed the next fourteen (14) taxable years. (8) In the event that qualified broadband equipment upon which the credit allowed by this section has been used ceases to qualify for the credit allowed by section 63-3029B, Idaho Code, or is subject to recapture of that credit, the recapture of credit under this section shall be in the same proportion and subject to the same provisions as the amount of credit required to be recaptured under section 63-3029B, Idaho Code. (9) (a) Subject to the requirements of this subsection, a taxpayer who earns and is entitled to the credit or to an unused portion of the credit allowed by this section may transfer all or a portion of the unused credit to: (i) Another taxpayer required to file a return under this chapter; or (ii) To an intermediary for its use or for resale to a taxpayer required to file a return under this chapter. In the event of either such a transfer, the transferee may claim the credit on the transferee’s income tax return originally filed during the calendar year in which the transfer takes place and, in the case of carryover of the credit, on the transferee’s returns for the number of years of carryover available to the transferor at the time of the transfer unless earlier exhausted. (b) Before completing a transfer under this subsection, the transferor shall notify the state tax commission of its intention to transfer the credit and the identity of the transferee. The state tax commission shall provide the transferor with a written statement of the amount of credit available under this section as then appearing in the commission’s records and the number of years the credit may be carried over. The transferee shall attach a copy of the statement to any return in regard to which the transferred credit is claimed. (c) In the event that after the transfer the state tax commission determines that the amount of credit properly available under this section is less than the amount claimed by the transferor of the credit or that the credit is subject to recapture, the commission shall assess the amount of overstated or recaptured credit as taxes due from the transferor and not the transferee. The assessment shall be made in the manner provided for a deficiency in taxes under this chapter. (10) In addition to other needed rules, the state tax commission may promulgate rules prescribing, in the case of S corporations, partnerships, trusts or estates, a method of attributing the credit under this section to the shareholders, partners or beneficiaries in proportion to their share of the income from the S corporation, partnership, trust or estate.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,805958,708754,622447,146250,63447,-1,-1,-1,28011,398840,329659,240681,39427,82458,46684,53165,5819,3586,-1,-1,69960,0,68386,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,126196,46795,236248,371353,-1,-1,4785437,14835,9439,24274,5071,4

(b) Cable services and video services bring important daily benefits to Illinois consumers by providing news, education, and entertainment. (c) Competitive cable service and video service providers are capable of providing new video programming services and competition to Illinois consumers and of decreasing the prices for video programming services paid by Illinois consumers. (d) Although there has been some competitive entry into the facilities-based video programming market since current franchising requirements in this State were enacted, further entry by facilities-based providers could benefit consumers, provided cable and video services are equitably available to all Illinois consumers at reasonable prices. (e) The provision of competitive cable services and video services is a matter of statewide concern that extends beyond the boundaries of individual local units of government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, public rights-of-way are limited resources over which the municipality has a custodial duty to ensure that they are used, repaired, and maintained in a manner that best serves the public interest. (f) The State authorization process and uniform standards and procedures in this Article are intended to enable rapid and widespread entry by competitive providers, which will bring to Illinois consumers the benefits of video competition, including providing consumers with more choice, lower prices, higher speed and more advanced Internet access, more diverse and varied news, public information, education, and entertainment programming, and will bring to this State and its local units of government the benefits of new infrastructure investment, job growth, and innovation in broadband and Internet protocol technologies and deployment. (g) Providing an incumbent cable or video service provider with the option to secure a State-issued authorization through the termination of existing cable franchises between incumbent cable and video service providers and any local franchising authority is part of the new regulatory framework established by this Article.

BPL services can also be used to enhance existing electric delivery systems, which can result in improved service and reliability for electric customers.(b) The legislature finds that access to quality, high speed broadband services is important to this state. BPL deployment in Texas has the potential to extend broadband service to customers where broadband access is currently not available and may provide an additional option for existing broadband consumers in Texas, resulting in a more competitive market for broadband services. The legislature further finds that BPL development in Texas is fully dependent upon the participation of electric utilities in this state that own and operate power lines and related facilities that are necessary for the construction of BPL systems and the provision of BPL services. (c) Consistent with the goal of increasing options for telecommunications in this state, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the deployment of BPL by permitting affiliates of the electric utility, or permitting unaffiliated entities, to own or operate all or a portion of such BPL systems. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the appropriate framework to support the deployment of BPL. (d) The legislature finds that an electric utility may choose to implement BPL under the procedures set forth in this chapter, but is not required to do so. The electric utility shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to implement BPL and may not be penalized for deciding to implement or not to implement BPL.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,12418881,10618854,8710894,2539881,938650,-1,-1,-1,240579,6007693,5057244,3757582,435390,1253507,1096103,1002046,53283,36809,-1,-1,1441257,16050,843317,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,2195101,822237,3090578,4784400,-1,-1,4785437,14835,9439,24274,5071,9
